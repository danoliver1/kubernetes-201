There are three policies we can apply

- **Privileged:** Unrestricted policy, providing the widest possible level of permissions. This policy allows for known privilege escalations.

- **Baseline:**	Minimally restrictive policy which prevents known privilege escalations. Allows the default (minimally specified) Pod configuration.

- **Restricted:** Heavily restricted policy, following current Pod hardening best practices.

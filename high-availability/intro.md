### Welcome!

In this scenario we'll learn a few things we can do to make a workload highly available.

We'll do this by

- Creating a `Deployment`

- Setting it to have multiple replicas

- Creating a `Pod Disruption Budget`

- Adding a workaround to prevent 503s

- Configuring readiness and liveness checks

- Setting up `Horizontal Pod Autoscaling`

### Welcome!

In this scenario we'll set up [Istio](https://istio.io) with Ambient mode enabled. 

We will work through an example to show the Ambient components and highlight the differences.

This lab roughly follows Istio's [Ambient Getting Started](https://istio.io/latest/docs/ambient/getting-started/) guide, but uses `Helm` to install Istio and the `Gateway API` to install the waypoint (more on this later).

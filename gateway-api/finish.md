### WELL DONE !

The Gateway API allows different teams to effictively manage their own resources.

For example,

 - **Cluster Operators:** responsible for Setting up and maintaining Istio and the Gateway CRDs.

 - **Platform Engineers:** responsible for creating the namespaces and Gateways, or providing a self-service method to provision these.

 - **Application Developer:** responsible for creating and deploying their application and defining the HTTP routes.
